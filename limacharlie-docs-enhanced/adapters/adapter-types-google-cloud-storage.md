## Overview

This Adapter allows you to ingest files/blobs stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

Note that this adapter operates as a sink by default, meaning it will "consume" files from the GCS bucket by deleting them once ingested.

## Configurations

Adapter Type: `gcs`

* `client_options`: common configuration for adapter as defined [here](/v2/docs/adapters#usage).
* `bucket_name`: the name of the bucket to ingest from.
* `service_account_creds`: the string version of the JSON credentials for a (Google) Service Account to use accessing the bucket.
* `prefix`: only ingest files with a given path prefix.
* `single_load`: if `true`, the adapter will not operate as a sink, it will ingest all files in the bucket once and will then exit.

## API Doc

See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage).

Adapters serve as flexible data ingestion mechanisms for both on-premise and cloud environments.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the management and provisioning of IT infrastructure using code, making it easier to scale, maintain, and deploy resources consistently. In LimaCharlie, IaC allows security teams to deploy and manage sensors, rules, and other security infrastructure programmatically, ensuring streamlined, repeatable configurations and faster response times, while maintaining infrastructure-as-code best practices in cybersecurity operations.
