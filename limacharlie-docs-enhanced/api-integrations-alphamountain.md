There are [three alphaMountain API integrations](https://app.limacharlie.io/add-ons/category/api) that can be subscribed with the appropriate API keys. When enabled and configured, alphaMountain resources can be used as an API-based lookup.

#### alphaMountain Category

Returns categorization for Internet URIs, generated by alphaMountain's own statistical and neural network models. For more information on alphaMountain's categories, visit [this page](https://alphamountain.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/66000280079-a9-web-protection-categories-grouped-).

#### alphaMountain Popularity

Returns the popularity of a domain, as measured by a combination of page-rank, daily traffic bandwidth, total number of requests, and passive DNS activity for a given hostname. For more information, visit [this page](https://www.alphamountain.ai/api/#tag/Domain/paths/~1popularity~1domain/post).

#### alphaMountain Threat

Returns threat ratings for Internet URIs, generated by alphaMountain's own statistical and neural network models, cross-validated by a variety of sources as appropriate. For more information, visit [this page](https://www.alphamountain.ai/threat-intelligence-feeds-api/).

## Detection & Response Rule

The following is an example  rule that pulls domain names from DNS\_REQUEST events and performs a lookup using alphaMountain's category API.

```
event: DNS_REQUEST
op: lookup
path: event/DOMAIN_NAME
resource: hive://lookup/alphamountain-category
```

The data returned is in JSON format, and includes the API response and a threatYeti URL, which is appended by LimaCharlie. For example:

```
{
  "api_alphamountain-category": {
    "categories": [
      34
    ],
    "confidence": 0.90371,
    "scope": "domain",
    "threatyeti_url": "https://www.threatyeti.com/search?q=logging-alv.googleapis.com"
  }
}
```
