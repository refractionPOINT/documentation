The SecOps Cloud Platform makes building, modifying, or streamlining your security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) operations simple. Lower your costs and increase your response time by aggregating SOAR tooling, integrating resources, and normalizing telemetry with the SecOps Cloud Platform.

#### SOAR/Automation problems

Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions play a key role in detecting and responding to cyber threats. However, adopting a standalone SOAR solution may also create new challenges including:

* **Alert fatigue:** Security analysts receive and evaluate countless alerts before uncovering and responding to legitimate issues.
* **High data costs:** Sending telemetry data to a SIEM can be an expensive, resource-intensive process that only increases as businesses grow, resulting in new endpoints and data sources.
* **Unnecessary detection friction:** Security tools detect suspicious activity and send events to the SIEM, generating an alert for the analyst to investigate. After investigation, various manual procedures are invoked to remediate the alert.
* **Inefficient manual processes:** Critical time is lost as analysts coordinate transferring crucial information into various tools and performing response actions.

#### LimaCharlie’s solutions

The SecOps Cloud Platform consolidates and integrates SOAR tooling in a single place. It offers a more efficient, customizable way to implement SOAR by integrating the security stack, normalizing data, and expanding automation capabilities.

* **Data normalization, collection, false positive rules, and filtering:** The LimaCharlie SecOps Cloud Platform collects and normalizes telemetry making it easy to filter out noise, share information between resources, and detect real problems.
* **Reduced data costs:** All events, telemetry, and detections within LimaCharlie are stored online and searchable for one year. This allows users to keep everything instead of aggregating and having to choose which data is important.
* **Bi-directionality:** LimaCharlie supports bi-directionality which allows automated responses to be sent directly to the source of a detection. For example, if the SecOps Cloud Platform receives a suspicious login alert from O365 it can send a direct automated response to suspend the account. This eliminates a persistence method for attackers.
* **API-first foundation:** LimaCharlie can perform critical response actions for any asset in your security stack via API. Automated responses can trigger remediation actions and send telemetry to security tooling without (comparatively slow) human intervention. Python playbooks allow you to automatically perform standard, repetitive tasks, reducing mean time to resolve, and allowing analysts to focus on higher priority alerts.
