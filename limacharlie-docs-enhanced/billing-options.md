LimaCharlie users have multiple billing options available to them, depending on their unique needs. We'll walk through these two options, *Default Billing* and *Unified Billing*, below.

### Default Billing

By default, every Organization is billed using a credit card set at the individual organization level. The billing cycle for each organization starts at the time the organization goes from the free tier into a paid tier. The invoices go to the email address of the user who initially created the organization.

### Unified Billing

For customers that require flexibility managing multiple organizations, LimaCharlie offers unified billing - the ability to customize billing to satisfy their needs.

All the options described below apply based on the “billing domain”, which is the domain name of the email address of a user. For example, the users `ceo@mycorp.com` and `sales@mycorp.com` both belong to the `mycorp.com` billing domain.

All organizations under the same billing domain will have their billing cycles on the same day, regardless of the creation time or the time the organization first exits free tier. Instead of receiving one invoice per organization, all invoices for a billing domain will be aggregated together under a single invoice sent manually monthly.

The following are the options you can customize as a part of the Unified Billing:

* Override the email where each individual organization’s invoice goes to. Instead of the email of the creator, a central email address (like billing@mycorp.com) is used. Billing domains with unified billing enabled will receive a monthly report summarizing all organizations under the domain and their respective billing.
* Choose to be invoiced manually. Organizations in a billing domain can have their invoices sent manually by email without the use of a credit card. This will then allow the recipient to pay invoices using ACH or credit card, but this will have to be done manually each month.

### Default Billing Setup vs Unified Billing

|  | Default Billing Setup | Unified Billing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Can be used by** | Anyone | Customers that have their users share a custom domain name of the email address (for example, the users `ceo@mycorp.com` and `sales@mycorp.com` both belong to the `mycorp.com` domain). |
| **Best suited for** | \* Customers that have one or a few (1-3) tenants to manage \* Enterprise clients that want to manage billing at the department level (billed to different cards) | \* Service providers (MSP, MSSP, DFIR) who manage multiple tenants \* Enterprise clients that want to manage billing at the company level (billed to one card) |
| **Payment method used** | Billed using a credit card set at the individual organization level. | One payment method will be used for all organizations under the same billing domain. |
| **Manual invoicing** | Not available | Available  Organizations in a billing domain can have their invoices sent manually by email without the use of a credit card. This will then allow the recipient to pay invoices using ACH or credit card, but this will have to be done manually each month. |
| **Billing cycle** | Starts at the time the organization goes from the free tier into a paying tier (different billing cycle for each tenant). | All organizations under the same billing domain will have their billing cycles on the same day. |
| **Invoicing** | Users will receive one invoice per organization. | All invoices for a billing domain will be aggregated together under a single invoice sent manually monthly. |
| **Email invoices go to** | Email address of the user who initially created the organization. | Instead of the email of the creator, a central email address (like `billing@mycorp.com`) is used. Billing domains with unified billing enabled will receive a monthly report summarizing all organizations under the domain and their respective billing. |

In LimaCharlie, an Organization represents a tenant within the SecOps Cloud Platform, providing a self-contained environment to manage security data, configurations, and assets independently. Each Organization has its own sensors, detection rules, data sources, and outputs, offering complete control over security operations. This structure enables flexible, multi-tenant setups, ideal for managed security providers or enterprises managing multiple departments or clients.
