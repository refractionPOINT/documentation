## Overview

The **Platform Events** section in LimaCharlie documentation details various event types generated by the platform to support monitoring and operational management. These events provide key insights into activities related to system performance, resource usage, billing, Sensor status, and cloud adapters. They include events for tracking changes, flow control, quota management, data ingestion, sensor deployment, and errors. The events help ensure smooth platform operation by notifying users of important updates, issues, or actions that require attention, offering comprehensive telemetry for effective management and troubleshooting across the platform.

Similar to agents, Sensors send telemetry to the LimaCharlie platform in the form of EDR telemetry or forwarded logs. Sensors are offered as a scalable, serverless solution for securely connecting endpoints of an organization to the cloud.
