# Azure

The Azure CLI is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources. With this component of the Cloud CLI Extension, you can interact with Azure directly from LimaCharlie.

This extension makes use of the Azure CLI, which can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli).

## Example

The following example returns a list of virtual machines and their respective details in Azure.


    - action: extension request
      extension action: run
      extension name: ext-cloud-cli
      extension request:
        cloud: '{{ "az" }}'
        command_line: '{{ "vm list" }}'
        credentials: '{{ "hive://secret/secret-name" }}'


## Credentials

To utilize the Azure CLI, you will need:

  * An application and a [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) with the appropriate permissions and a [client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-3-create-a-new-client-secret)

  * Create a secret in the secrets manager in the following format:


    appID/clientSecret/tenantID
