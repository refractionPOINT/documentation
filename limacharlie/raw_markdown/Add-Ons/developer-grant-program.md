The Developer Grant Program is designed to help fuel the growth of LimaCharlie add-ons and other projects that utilize the LimaCharlie platform. To help developers with their projects, we offer a $1,000 credit that can be applied towards using LimaCharlie to develop any kind of project you want.

If you are looking to commercialize an idea we can help you get it into our marketplace and if there is traction there, we can further support you in growing.

Interested parties can apply for the grant program [here](https://limacharlie.io/grant-program).
