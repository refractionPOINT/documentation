LimaCharlie's SecOps Cloud Platform provides a cost-effective and flexible alternative or supplement to traditional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) offering essential capabilities while addressing the challenges of high costs, vendor lock-in, and complexity. By leveraging LimaCharlie's interoperability, automation, and detection and response () capabilities, security teams can optimize their operations and maintain a robust posture without the high costs and limitations of legacy SIEM solutions.

#### SIEM problems

The capabilities of SIEM solutions are essential for managing logs, correlating events, monitoring and alerting, and storing telemetry data. However, traditional SIEMs often present several challenges for organizations:

  * **High costs:** SIEMs are typically very expensive to implement and maintain, with costs escalating as data volumes grow and additional features are required.

  * **Vendor lock-in:** Many SIEMs are proprietary, closed systems that make it difficult for organizations to switch providers or integrate with other security tools.

  * **Complexity:** SIEMs can be complex to set up and manage, requiring specialized skills and resources that may strain already overburdened security teams.




#### LimaCharlie’s solution

LimaCharlie's SecOps Cloud Platform offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional SIEMs, providing essential capabilities while addressing the challenges of high costs, vendor lock-in, and complexity:

  * **Cost savings through flexible data management:** LimaCharlie provides one year of free telemetry storage in a fully searchable format, reducing the need to store all data in expensive SIEMs. The platform's ability to classify, filter, and route telemetry data intelligently allows organizations to send only critical data to their SIEM, further reducing costs.

  * **Interoperability and customization:** Built with interoperability in mind, LimaCharlie seamlessly integrates with a wide range of security tools and platforms, enabling organizations to create custom workflows and avoid vendor lock-in. The platform's open architecture and extensive API support make it easy to integrate with existing security infrastructure.

  * **Automation and ease of use:** LimaCharlie's Detection, Automation, and Response Engine enables security teams to create sophisticated detection rulesets and automate response actions, reducing alert fatigue and simplifying security operations. The SecOps Cloud Platform's powerful query language (LCQL) makes it easy for security professionals to access and analyze telemetry data without the complexity of traditional SIEMs.

  * **Advanced capabilities:** LimaCharlie offers advanced threat hunting and integration with third-party threat intelligence platforms, providing security teams with the context and insights they need to identify and respond to threats effectively.
