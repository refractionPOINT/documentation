# Sleeper Mode

LimaCharlie's sleeper mode is not just about cost-efficiency; it's about transforming your entire network into a dynamic, responsive security infrastructure. By pre-deploying sensors and strategically activating them during incidents, you gain the element of surprise, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately, mitigate the impact of cyberattacks with unmatched agility.

#### Traditional sensor deployment problems

Traditional IR relies on reactive deployment of sensors, leaving critical blind spots during early stages of an incident. Delays in gaining visibility slow down response times and increase damage potential.

  * **Limited visibility:** Lack of visibility during the early stages of an incident due to the absence of pre-deployed sensors.

  * **Manual processes:** Delayed response times caused by the need to manually deploy sensors after an incident has been detected.

  * **Delayed response:** Increased potential for damage and lateral movement of threats while waiting for sensor deployment and data collection.




#### LimaCharlie’s solution

Sleeper mode transforms your entire network into a pre-wired security grid. Sensors sit silently, consuming minimal resources while collecting basic system information and detecting critical events. This provides:

  * **Instant Activation, Rapid Response:** Need deep process monitoring or memory forensic capabilities? Instantly activate sleepers within the affected area, gaining full-fledged EDR visibility for targeted investigation and containment. No more waiting for manual installation during critical moments.

  * **Surgical Precision:** Focus resources where they matter most. Activate sleepers only on specific endpoints or clusters suspected of involvement, reducing unnecessary data collection and analysis overload. This streamlines investigations and saves valuable time.

  * **Critical Assets Under Cover:** Pre-deploy sensors in sleeper mode on high-value servers, executive machines, or sensitive data repositories. When an incident strikes, instant activation grants immediate visibility and control, safeguarding your most crucial assets.

  * **Targeted Threat Hunting:** Identify potential targets based on threat intelligence or internal red teaming exercises. Pre-emptively activate sleepers in these areas, creating a proactive surveillance network to catch early signs of malicious activity.

  * **Isolate and Contain:** Sleeper mode empowers swift containment. Upon detecting suspicious activity, activate neighboring sleepers to cordon off the affected area, preventing lateral movement and limiting damage.

  * **Deep Dive Forensics:** Need detailed forensic disk or memory analysis? Activate the relevant sleeper for comprehensive forensic investigation, dissecting the incident and identifying root causes for future prevention.
