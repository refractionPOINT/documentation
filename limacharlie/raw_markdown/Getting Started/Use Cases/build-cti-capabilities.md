#### Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) gathering problems

  * **Fragmented and siloed data:** Security teams often struggle to gain a holistic understanding of threats due to siloed data from disparate security tools and sensors. This fragmented intelligence hinders effective threat detection, investigation, and response.

  * **Manual correlation:** Manually correlating data points from diverse sources is time-consuming and error-prone, making it difficult to identify emerging threats and uncover hidden connections.

  * **Visibility gaps:** Unknown malware and suspicious binaries often fly under the radar of traditional antivirus solutions, leaving organizations vulnerable to zero-day attacks and advanced threats.

#### LimaCharlie's solution

  * **Data consolidation:** Aggregate telemetry from all your security tools, endpoints, and network sources into a single platform. LimaCharlie's comprehensive data ingestion capabilities break down data silos and unify your threat intelligence landscape.

  * **Seamless integrations:** Leverage LimaCharlie's robust API integrations to seamlessly connect with external threat feeds, threat intelligence platforms, and security tools. Enrich your internal data with external insights for a broader view of the threat landscape.

  * **Private binary library:** Analyze unknown binaries and suspicious files with LimaCharlie's built-in Binary Library. This private VirusTotal-like environment leverages community and internal threat intelligence to rapidly identify malware, even zero-day variants, and assess associated risks.

  * **Utilize YARA rules:** Conduct enterprise-wide malware scanning with LimaCharlie's integrated YARA engine. Utilize your own or community-developed YARA rules to detect specific malware families, variants, and even customized threats tailored to your environment, leaving no malicious code undetected.
