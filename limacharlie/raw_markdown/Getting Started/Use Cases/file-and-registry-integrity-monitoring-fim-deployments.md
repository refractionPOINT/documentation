Use the SecOps Cloud Platform to gain comprehensive visibility, control, and proactive protection for sensitive files and registry keys with LimaCharlie's robust FIM capabilities.

#### FIM deployment problems

  * **Undetected unauthorized changes:** Malicious actors often target sensitive files and registry keys to install malware, exfiltrate data, or disrupt operations, often evading traditional security measures.

  * **Challenges of manual monitoring:** Manually tracking changes to critical files and registry entries across large environments is time-consuming, error-prone, and often reactive rather than proactive.

  * **Limited visibility into past events:** Traditional FIM tools might lack comprehensive historical data storage, hindering investigations and threat hunting efforts.

  * **Fragmented solutions:** File and registry integrity monitoring can be siloed in separate platforms or integrated with data loss prevention (DLP) tools, lacking the comprehensive visibility and detection capabilities of a unified security platform.




#### LimaCharlie’s solution

  * **Unified Visibility and Response:** Consolidate FIM with other endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities within LimaCharlie, eliminating the need for separate platforms and streamlining security operations.

  * **Continuous Monitoring and Alerting:** LimaCharlie's FIM capability continuously monitors designated files and registry keys for any modifications, generating real-time alerts to security teams for immediate action.

  * **Granular Configuration and Rules:** Define specific files, directories, and registry paths to monitor based on your unique security needs, ensuring focused protection for critical assets.

  * **Historical Data Storage and Analysis:** LimaCharlie stores one year of historical FIM data, enabling in-depth investigations, threat hunting, and identification of potential attack patterns that might have been missed initially.
