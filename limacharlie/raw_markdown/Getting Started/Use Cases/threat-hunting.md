  * **Limited visibility into past activity:** Traditional security solutions focus on real-time threats, leaving hidden attacker footprints and lingering malware remnants undetected in historical data.

  * **Cumbersome historical data analysis:** Complex log aggregation and analysis tools hinder efficient threat hunting investigations across vast datasets, delaying threat discovery and response.
