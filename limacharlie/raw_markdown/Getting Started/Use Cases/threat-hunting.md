#### Threat hunting problems

  * **Limited visibility into past activity:** Traditional security solutions focus on real-time threats, leaving hidden attacker footprints and lingering malware remnants undetected in historical data.

  * **Cumbersome historical data analysis:** Complex log aggregation and analysis tools hinder efficient threat hunting investigations across vast datasets, delaying threat discovery and response.

  * **Static detection and response:** The disconnect between reactive threat hunts and proactive defense leaves organizations vulnerable to future attacks from similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
