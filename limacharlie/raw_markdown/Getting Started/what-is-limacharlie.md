LimaCharlie is the **SecOps Cloud Platform** \- delivering security operations for the modern era.

LimaCharlie’s SecOps Cloud Platform provides you with comprehensive enterprise protection that brings together critical cybersecurity capabilities and eliminates integration challenges and security gaps for more effective protection against today’s threats.

The SecOps Cloud Platform offers a unified platform where you can build customized solutions effortlessly. With open APIs, centralized telemetry, and automated detection and response mechanisms, it’s time cybersecurity moves into the modern era.

Simplifying procurement, deployment and integration of best-of-breed cybersecurity solutions, the SecOps Cloud Platform delivers complete protection tailored to each organization’s specific needs, much in the same way IT Clouds have supported enterprises for years.

Our documentation can walk you through setting up your own Organization, deploying Sensors, writing detection and response rules, or outputting your data to any destination of your choosing. To dive in immediately, see our [Quickstart](/v2/docs/quickstart) guide.

Dig in, and build the security program you need and have always wanted.

In LimaCharlie, an Organization represents a tenant within the SecOps Cloud Platform, providing a self-contained environment to manage security data, configurations, and assets independently. Each Organization has its own sensors, detection rules, data sources, and outputs, offering complete control over security operations. This structure enables flexible, multi-tenant setups, ideal for managed security providers or enterprises managing multiple departments or clients.

Similar to agents, Sensors send telemetry to the LimaCharlie platform in the form of EDR telemetry or forwarded logs. Sensors are offered as a scalable, serverless solution for securely connecting endpoints of an organization to the cloud.
