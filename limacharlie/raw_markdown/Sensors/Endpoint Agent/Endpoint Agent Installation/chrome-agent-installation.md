# Chrome Agent Installation

LimaCharlie's Chrome Sensor is built as a browser extension and provides visibility for activity performed within the browser. This sensor is particularly useful for gaining affordable network visibility in organizations that make heavy use of ChromeOS.

It is delivered as the [LimaCharlie Sensor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/limacharlie-sensor/ljdgkaegafdgakkjekimaehhneieecki) extension available in the Chrome Web Store.

## Installation Instructions

The Chrome sensor is available in the Chrome Web Store.

  1. In the LimaCharlie web app (app.limacharlie.io), go to the "Installation Keys" section, select your Installation Key and click the "Chrome Key" copy icon to copy the key to your clipboard.

  2. Install the sensor from: <https://downloads.limacharlie.io/sensor/chrome>

  3. A new tab will open where you can add your installation key from before. If you close it by mistake, you can re-open it by:

    1. From the Extensions page at chrome://extensions/ click on the "Details" button of the LimaCharlie Sensor extension.

    2. Go to the "Extension options" section, and enter your installation key from the previous step. Click save.

The installation key can also be pre-configured through the Managed Storage feature (key named `installation_key`) if you are using a managed Chrome deployment.
