# Edge Agent Installation

LimaCharlie's Edge Sensor is delivered as the [LimaCharlie Sensor](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/limacharlie-sensor/nomgmkpkkncolnpbkbamfnjhbhmnjehp) extension, available as an Edge Add-on.

## Edge Installation Instructions

The Edge sensor is available in the Edge Add-ons section.

1. In the LimaCharlie web app (app.limacharlie.io), go to the "Installation Keys" section, select your Installation Key and click the "Chrome Key" copy icon to copy the key to your clipboard.
2. Install the sensor from: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/limacharlie-sensor/nomgmkpkkncolnpbkbamfnjhbhmnjehp
3. A new tab will open where you can add your installation key from before.

Similar to agents, Sensors send telemetry to the LimaCharlie platform in the form of EDR telemetry or forwarded logs. Sensors are offered as a scalable, serverless solution for securely connecting endpoints of an organization to the cloud.

Installation keys are Base64-encoded strings provided to Sensors and Adapters in order to associate them with the correct Organization. Installation keys are created per-organization and offer a way to label and control your deployment population.
