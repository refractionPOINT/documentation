## Problems monitoring DevOps security

- **Blind Spots in the Pipeline:** Siloed DevOps data from code repositories, third-party tools, and SaaS platforms leaves security teams in the dark, unable to detect threats hidden within routine operations.
- **Reactive Response, Slowed Agility:** Manual security checks and sluggish incident response hinder DevOps agility, creating vulnerable gaps between development and deployment.
- **DevSecOps Disconnect:** Disparate tools and fragmented communication between security and operations teams lead to inefficient incident response and missed opportunities for proactive mitigation.
