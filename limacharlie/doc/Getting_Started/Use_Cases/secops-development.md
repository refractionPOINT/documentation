# SecOps Development

The SecOps Cloud Platform accelerates building, customizing, integrating, and scaling security operations. By handling the infrastructure-intensive aspects of security engineering, LimaCharlie takes on the heavy lifting making it easy for developers to focus on their core projects.

#### SecOps development problems

Innovating new security products and modifying existing ones is crucial for protecting organizations from evolving cyberthreats. Unfortunately, the process of building better cybersecurity solutions is often hampered by:

* **Time consuming infrastructure management:** Developers spend too much time building, maintaining, and updating infrastructure instead of working on projects.
* **Integration headaches:** Valuable time is lost to solving integration issues between the tools, services, and platforms critical to a project's success.
* **Scalability issues:** While your solution works well at a small scale there are serious concerns over whether it can scale effectively as your business grows.
* **Lack of control:** Your project relies on third-party or open source tooling that lacks the flexibility you need to succeed.

#### LimaCharlie's solution

The SecOps Cloud Platform delivers core security capabilities in the form of "primitives" that can be modified to accommodate specific needs. It offers infrastructure-as-code and other resources that can improve a developer's mean-time-to-market, including:

* **Infrastructure-as-a-service:** LimaCharlie delivers security-oriented cloud-primitives that provide scalable infrastructure and critical resources for your project development. Think AWS, but for security.
* **API-first foundation:** The SecOps Cloud Platform (SCP) is built upon an API-first foundation. Information normalized and shared via API, freeing you from vendor lock-in and giving you maximum flexibility.
* **Seamless scalability:** The SCP is a cloud platform, and scales effortlessly with the growth of your company.
* **Maximum flexibility:** The SCP offers full transparency and granular management of the resources you choose to incorporate. Where third-party tools or open source solutions offer roadblocks, the SCP provides the capability to customize, innovate, and create needed capabilities.
