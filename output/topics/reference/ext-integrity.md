# Integrity Extension

The Integrity Extension helps you manage all aspects of file or registry integrity monitoring (FIM and RIM, respectively). This extension automates integrity checks of file system and registry values through pattern-based rules.

## Enabling the Integrity Extension

To enable the Integrity extension, navigate to the [Integrity extension page](https://app.limacharlie.io/add-ons/extension-detail/ext-integrity) in the marketplace. Select the Organization you wish to enable the extension for, and select **Subscribe**.

After clicking **Subscribe**, the Integrity extension should be available almost immediately.

## Using the Integrity Extension

Once enabled, you will see a **File/Reg Integrity** option under **Automation** within the LimaCharlie web UI.

Selecting this option allows you to customize **File & Registry Integrity Monitoring** rules.

Selecting **Add Monitoring Rule** will allow you to create a FIM or RIM rule, specifying a platform, Tag(s), and pattern(s).

### Rule Patterns

Patterns are file or registry patterns and support wildcards (\*, ?, +). Windows directory separators (backslash, `"\"`) must be escaped with a double-slash `"\\"`.

When a FIM or RIM rule is tripped, you will see a `FIM_HIT` event in the Sensor(s) timeline.

### Example Rule Patterns

#### Windows File Monitoring

| **Monitor a specific directory on all drives** | **Monitor a specific file on a specific drive** |
| --- | --- |
| ?:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers | C:\\Windows\\System32\\specialfile.exe |
| ?:\\inetpub\\wwwroot |  |

#### Windows Registry Monitoring

> All registry monitoring patterns MUST begin with **\\REGISTRY**, followed by the hive and then the path or value to monitor.

| Monitor for changes to system Run and RunOnce | Monitor all users for additions to a user's Run |
| --- | --- |
| \\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\* | \\REGISTRY\\USER\\S-\*\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\* |
| \\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\* |  |

#### Linux

| **Monitor for changes to root's authorized\_keys** | **Monitor for changes to all user private ssh directories** |
| --- | --- |
| /root/.ssh/authorized\_keys | /home/\*/.ssh/\* |

#### macOS

| Monitor for changes to user keychains | Monitor for changes to system keychains |
| --- | --- |
| /Users/\*/Library/Keychains/\* | /Library/Keychains |

### Linux Support

FIM is supported on Linux systems, however, support may vary based on Linux distribution and software.

#### Linux with eBPF Support

Linux hosts capable of running with [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) have file notification and FIM capabilities on par with Windows and macOS.

#### Legacy Support

FIM is partially supported on systems without eBPF. Specified file expressions are actively monitored via `inotify` (as opposed to macOS and Windows, which utilize passive kernel monitoring). Due to [inotify](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html) limitations, paths with wildcards are less efficient and only support monitoring up to 20 sub-directories covered by the wildcard. In addition to this, the path expressions should specify a final wildcard of `*` when all files under a directory need to be monitored. Omitting the final `*` will result in only the top-level directory being monitored.
