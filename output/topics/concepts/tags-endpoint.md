I need to see the actual documentation content to clean it. The text you provided appears to be a navigation page or index showing a list of articles tagged with "endpoint agent", but it doesn't contain the actual documentation content that needs to be cleaned.

Could you please provide the raw markdown file of the specific documentation page you want me to clean? For example, if you want me to clean the "Ingesting Linux Audit Logs" page or the "Reference: EDR Events" page, I'll need the full content of that specific page.

Alternatively, if you have a specific file path to the raw markdown file, I can read it using the Read tool and then clean it for you.
