I notice you've provided instructions for cleaning documentation, but the actual content shown appears to be a navigation/tag page rather than a documentation article to clean. The page shows:

- A logo
- Tag filtering UI ("Tag: incident response")
- Version switchers (v1 Deprecated, v2)
- A message stating "No Articles found for incident response Tag"

This is **not** a documentation page with actual content - it's an empty tag/category page from the LimaCharlie documentation site.

**There is no documentation content to clean here.**

If you intended to clean a specific documentation page, please provide:
1. The actual documentation page content (not a tag/category page)
2. Or the URL of the page you want me to fetch and clean

Would you like me to:
- Fetch and clean a specific LimaCharlie documentation page?
- Process a different markdown file from your repository?
- Help with something else related to your documentation pipeline?
