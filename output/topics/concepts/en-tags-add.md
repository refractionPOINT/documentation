# Atomic Red Team

**Atomic Red Team** provides a library of test cases that can be executed through LimaCharlie to validate your detection capabilities. Each test simulates a specific ATT&CK technique, allowing you to verify that your security controls can detect real adversary behaviors.

## Overview

The Atomic Red Team extension enables you to:

- Execute atomic tests from the Atomic Red Team project
- Validate detection rules against known adversary techniques
- Map tests to MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Generate telemetry for security control validation

## Prerequisites

- LimaCharlie sensor deployed on target system
- Appropriate permissions to execute tests
- Understanding of tests being run (some may create artifacts)

## Installation

1. Navigate to **Add-ons** in the LimaCharlie web interface
2. Find **Atomic Red Team** in the available add-ons
3. Click **Subscribe** or **Enable**
4. Configure the extension settings as needed

## Usage

### Running Atomic Tests

Tests can be executed directly through the LimaCharlie interface or via API. Each test corresponds to a specific ATT&CK technique and will generate observable telemetry.

### Test Execution

```yaml
action: atomic_test
technique: T1055
test_number: 1
```

### Validating Detections

After running a test:

1. Review telemetry generated by the sensor
2. Verify detection rules triggered appropriately
3. Tune rules if detections were missed
4. Document coverage for compliance

## Best Practices

- **Test in non-production first**: Many tests create artifacts or modify system state
- **Document test results**: Track which techniques you've validated
- **Regular testing**: Run tests periodically to catch detection regressions
- **Cleanup**: Some tests require manual cleanup of artifacts
- **Review prerequisites**: Each test may have specific requirements

## Integration with Detection Rules

Atomic Red Team pairs well with LimaCharlie's Detection & Response (D&R) rules. After running tests, you can create or tune D&R rules based on the observable telemetry.

## Security Considerations

> **Warning**: Atomic tests simulate real attack techniques and may be flagged by security tools. Ensure you have authorization before running tests and understand the impact of each test.
