# Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

The SecOps Cloud Platform revolutionizes endpoint security by providing true real-time visibility, versatile detection capabilities, integration with open-source and managed rulesets, and vendor-agnostic telemetry ingestion. By leveraging LimaCharlie's API-first approach, flexible billing model, and seamless integration with your existing security stack, security teams can effectively detect, investigate, and respond to threats while avoiding the limitations of traditional EDR solutions.

## EDR problems

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions are crucial for organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to threats on endpoints. However, traditional EDR solutions often present several challenges:

* **Lack of real-time visibility:** Many EDR solutions rely on periodic scans or delayed data collection, making it difficult to detect and respond to threats in real-time.
* **Limited customization and flexibility:** Traditional EDRs often use proprietary detection languages or rulesets, limiting the ability of security teams to create custom detections tailored to their unique environments.
* **Vendor lock-in and high costs:** Legacy EDR solutions often require long-term contracts, have high minimum commitments, and can be expensive to scale, leading to vendor lock-in and budget constraints.

## LimaCharlie's solution

* **True real-time EDR:** LimaCharlie provides true real-time visibility by streaming verbose telemetry from the endpoint sensor to the cloud over a semi-persistent TLS connection. This enables response actions to be taken on the endpoint within 100ms of the triggering action or behavior, drastically reducing the time to detect and respond to threats.
* **Versatile detection syntax:** LimaCharlie uses a YAML-based detection syntax that allows security teams to create highly sophisticated detections, including the ability to track state and build multi-step detection logic. This versatile syntax empowers security teams to create custom detections tailored to their specific needs and environment.
* **Integration with open-source and managed rulesets:** Leverage detections created by best-in-class security professionals using managed and open-source rulesets. With one-click access to sources like SOC Prime, Soteria, Sigma, and YARA, teams can gain unparalleled cost efficiencies and stay ahead of emerging threats.
* **Reduced mean time to respond (MTTR):** LimaCharlie allows security teams to execute a full suite of remediation responses, such as triggering memory dumps or killing process trees. By simplifying the process of activating rulesets and building custom rules, LimaCharlie significantly reduces MTTR.
* **Vendor-agnostic telemetry ingestion:** Ingest data from any source, including existing EDR solutions, in real-time. This allows security teams to avoid vendor lock-in and leverage the SCP's powerful Detection, Automation, and Response Engine on all of their telemetry, regardless of the source.
