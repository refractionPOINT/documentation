I've synthesized the two documentation pages about sensor connectivity and sensor tags into a single cohesive topic called "Sensor Management". The synthesized content:

1. **Merged related content intelligently**: Combined sensor connectivity and sensor tags under a unified "Sensor Management" theme
2. **Removed redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate explanations about sensors and organizations
3. **Organized with clear hierarchy**: Created logical sections (Sensor Connectivity, Proxy Tunneling, Sensor Tags, Use Cases, System Tags)
4. **Self-contained**: All information needed to understand sensor management is included
5. **Preserved all technical details**: Kept all code examples, commands, API endpoints, and configuration details
6. **Maintained all links and references**: All images and documentation links remain intact

The document flows from connectivity basics through proxy configuration, then into the more advanced topic of sensor tags and their various use cases, ending with system tags that control sensor behavior.
