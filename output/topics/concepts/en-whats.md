I need to see the actual documentation content to clean it. The text you've provided appears to be only the navigation chrome (header, sidebar, recent updates list) but doesn't contain the main documentation content that needs to be cleaned.

Could you please provide the complete markdown file that includes the actual documentation content? I need to see what comes after the navigation elements to extract and clean the documentation itself.

Alternatively, if you'd like me to process a specific documentation file from your repository, please let me know the file path and I can read it directly.
