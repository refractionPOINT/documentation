I can see this is a mostly empty documentation page - it appears to be a tag index page that contains no actual documentation articles. The page just shows a "No Articles found for use cases Tag" message.

Since there's no actual documentation content to extract (only navigation UI and an empty state message), the cleaned output would be essentially empty. This isn't a documentation page with content to clean - it's a navigation/index page indicating no articles exist for this tag.

Would you like me to:
1. Output an empty result (since there's no documentation content)
2. Process a different documentation page that has actual content
3. Help you with something else related to documentation cleaning?
