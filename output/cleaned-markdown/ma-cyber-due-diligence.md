# M&A Cyber Due Diligence

LimaCharlie makes merger and acquisition (M&A) cyber due diligence cost-effective and easy to deploy, allowing you to only pay for the resources you need. However, our extensible platform allows you to add as many tools as needed, all within a single agent, streamlining the assessment process.

## M&A problems

* **Inefficiencies in evaluating risks and vulnerabilities:** During the M&A process, it's crucial to identify and assess the cybersecurity risks associated with the target company's digital assets, including intellectual property, customer data, and financial information.
* **Complex infrastructures:** Merging two organizations' IT infrastructures can be a complex and time-consuming process which requires a smooth and secure integration of the acquired company's network into the parent company's infrastructure.
* **Limited visibility and control:** After the M&A process is complete, it's essential to continuously monitor and manage the merged organization's cybersecurity posture.

## LimaCharlie's solution

* **Cost-effective and scalable:** LimaCharlie allows you to be a cost-effective, scalable solution to perform a compromise assessment on to-be-acquired networks, and evaluate pre-existing threats.
* **Continuous visibility and control:** Automated, detection-as-code integration with powerful rulesets like Sigma and YARA rules provide continuous visibility into the merged organization's infrastructure, enabling you to detect and respond to potential threats in real-time.
* **Integrate with any tool:** Our extensible platform allows you to customize your additional tools, all through a single agent, achieving maximum performance with minimal footprint.
* **Centralized telemetry:** LimaCharlie's centralized platform provides a single pane of glass for monitoring and managing the merged infrastructure, simplifying the integration process and reducing the risk of security gaps.
