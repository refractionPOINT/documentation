**Note**: This appears to be a tag/category index page listing articles tagged with "google workspace". To properly clean the documentation, I would need access to the actual article content from the linked pages:

1. `/docs/en/adapter-types-google-workspace` 
2. `/docs/en/chrome-enterprise`

If you need these specific articles cleaned, please provide the raw markdown content from those individual documentation pages.
