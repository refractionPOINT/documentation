# Clean Documentation Task

I'll extract the clean documentation content from this page, removing all UI chrome and navigation elements.

However, I notice this input appears to be **only the website's header navigation and sidebar** - there's no actual documentation content visible in what you've provided. The page shows:

- Logo and header
- Navigation filters (v1/v2, date ranges)
- A sidebar list of recently updated articles with links

But there's **no main documentation content** to clean.

## What I Need

Could you please provide the **full page content** that includes:
- The navigation/header (which you've shown)
- **The main documentation content** (which is missing)
- Any footer elements

## How to Get the Full Content

If you're using a tool to convert HTML to markdown, make sure it's capturing the entire page body, not just the navigation elements. The main content area should contain the actual documentation text, code examples, explanations, etc.

Once you provide the complete page with the actual documentation content, I'll clean it according to the specifications - removing all the navigation chrome while preserving the core documentation.
