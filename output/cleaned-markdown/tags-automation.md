# SOAR / Automation

LimaCharlie's SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) capabilities enable you to automate security operations and incident response workflows.

## Overview

The platform provides powerful automation features that allow you to:

- Create automated response workflows
- Orchestrate complex security operations
- Integrate with external tools and services
- Build custom detection and response logic
- Scale security operations efficiently

## Key Features

### Detection & Response (D&R) Rules

D&R rules are the foundation of LimaCharlie's automation capabilities. They allow you to:

- Define detection logic based on telemetry events
- Trigger automated responses when threats are detected
- Create complex multi-stage detection scenarios
- Respond to threats in real-time

### Outputs and Integrations

LimaCharlie supports numerous output integrations to connect your security workflows:

- SIEM integrations (Splunk, Elastic, etc.)
- Ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow, etc.)
- Communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.)
- Custom webhooks for any external service

### Automation Service

The Automation Service provides advanced capabilities for:

- Running scheduled tasks
- Executing complex multi-step workflows
- Managing long-running operations
- Coordinating actions across multiple systems

### Response Actions

When detections occur, you can automatically:

- Isolate compromised endpoints
- Kill malicious processes
- Collect forensic evidence
- Block network connections
- Execute custom remediation scripts

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic detection rules and gradually increase complexity
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Use LimaCharlie's testing features to validate rules before deployment
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track rule execution and adjust as needed
4. **Document Workflows**: Maintain clear documentation of your automation logic
5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically audit and update automation rules

## Use Cases

- **Threat Hunting**: Automate searches for indicators of compromise
- **Incident Response**: Orchestrate response actions across your infrastructure
- **Compliance**: Automate evidence collection and reporting
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrate threat feeds and automate enrichment
- **User Behavior Analytics**: Detect anomalous activities automatically

## Getting Started

To begin using LimaCharlie's automation capabilities:

1. Define your security objectives and use cases
2. Create D&R rules for common threats
3. Configure output integrations for alerting
4. Test your automation workflows
5. Monitor and refine based on results
