# Use Cases

LimaCharlie provides a flexible security infrastructure platform that supports various security operations and detection engineering workflows. Below are common use cases and implementation patterns.

## Detection Engineering

Build and deploy custom detection rules across your infrastructure:

- Create detection & response (D&R) rules using LimaCharlie's rule engine
- Test detections in real-time against live telemetry
- Deploy rules across sensor groups or specific endpoints
- Iterate quickly with immediate feedback

## Threat Hunting

Leverage LimaCharlie's telemetry and querying capabilities:

- Search historical events using structured queries
- Pivot across related events and artifacts
- Export findings for further analysis
- Create detections from hunting discoveries

## Incident Response

Respond to security events with integrated response capabilities:

- Execute remote commands on endpoints
- Collect forensic artifacts (memory dumps, files, logs)
- Isolate compromised systems from the network
- Coordinate response actions through automation

## Security Operations Platform

Build a complete security operations infrastructure:

- Centralize telemetry from multiple sources
- Integrate with external tools via APIs and webhooks
- Create custom dashboards and reporting
- Automate security workflows with outputs and integrations

## Compliance and Auditing

Support compliance requirements through visibility and evidence collection:

- Maintain audit trails of security events
- Generate compliance reports from telemetry
- Monitor configuration changes
- Document security controls and coverage

## Security Research and Development

Develop and test security tools and detections:

- Access raw telemetry streams for analysis
- Prototype detection logic rapidly
- Test against diverse operating systems
- Validate detection efficacy before production deployment

## Managed Security Services

Deliver security services to multiple customers:

- Multi-tenant architecture with organization isolation
- Centralized management across customer environments
- Scalable deployment and configuration
- API-driven automation for service delivery
