Ditch the data silos and sluggish response – LimaCharlie illuminates your DevOps pipeline, automates threat detection and response, and fosters real-time collaboration, empowering you to build secure and resilient software at record speed.

#### Problems monitoring DevOps security

* **Blind Spots in the Pipeline:** Siloed DevOps data from code repositories, third-party tools, and SaaS platforms leaves security teams in the dark, unable to detect threats hidden within routine operations.
* **Reactive Response, Slowed Agility:** Manual security checks and sluggish incident response hinder DevOps agility, creating vulnerable gaps between development and deployment.
* **DevSecOps Disconnect:** Disparate tools and fragmented communication between security and operations teams lead to inefficient incident response and missed opportunities for proactive mitigation.

#### LimaCharlie’s solution

* **Unified Visibility Across the Flow:** LimaCharlie's architecture effortlessly ingests telemetry from all your DevOps data sources, providing a unified view of your entire pipeline from code commits to production deployments.
* **Automated Threat Detection and Response:** Leverage LimaCharlie's pre-built and custom detection rules to automatically identify suspicious activities within your DevOps data. Trigger instant alerts and pre-defined response actions, including stopping deployments, rolling back changes, or notifying teams.
* **Centralized Collaboration for Faster Response:** Break down silos with LimaCharlie's collaborative platform. Security and operations teams can visualize incidents across the pipeline, analyze threats jointly, and orchestrate coordinated responses in real-time.
