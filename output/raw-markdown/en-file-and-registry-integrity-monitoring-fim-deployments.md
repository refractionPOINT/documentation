Article summary

Thank you for your feedback!

Use the SecOps Cloud Platform to gain comprehensive visibility, control, and proactive protection for sensitive files and registry keys with LimaCharlie's robust FIM capabilities.

#### FIM deployment problems

* **Undetected unauthorized changes:** Malicious actors often target sensitive files and registry keys to install malware, exfiltrate data, or disrupt operations, often evading traditional security measures.
* **Challenges of manual monitoring:** Manually tracking changes to critical files and registry entries across large environments is time-consuming, error-prone, and often reactive rather than proactive.
* **Limited visibility into past events:** Traditional FIM tools might lack comprehensive historical data storage, hindering investigations and threat hunting efforts.
* **Fragmented solutions:** File and registry integrity monitoring can be siloed in separate platforms or integrated with data loss prevention (DLP) tools, lacking the comprehensive visibility and detection capabilities of a unified security platform.

#### LimaCharlie’s solution

* **Unified Visibility and Response:** Consolidate FIM with other endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities within LimaCharlie, eliminating the need for separate platforms and streamlining security operations.
* **Continuous Monitoring and Alerting:** LimaCharlie's FIM capability continuously monitors designated files and registry keys for any modifications, generating real-time alerts to security teams for immediate action.
* **Granular Configuration and Rules:** Define specific files, directories, and registry paths to monitor based on your unique security needs, ensuring focused protection for critical assets.
* **Historical Data Storage and Analysis:** LimaCharlie stores one year of historical FIM data, enabling in-depth investigations, threat hunting, and identification of potential attack patterns that might have been missed initially.
