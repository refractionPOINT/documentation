Article summary

Thank you for your feedback!

The SecOps Cloud Platform simplifies the difficult task of securing cloud resources and managing complex cloud-based or hybrid infrastructure. LimaCharlie brings better visibility, robust interoperability, and better options for storing data to cloud and hybrid environments.

#### Cloud security problems

Organizations are increasingly embracing the benefits of cloud services and solutions. As your business infrastructure integrates with cloud resources securing your environment becomes more complex, leading to:

* **Visibility challenges:** Cloud environments suffer from a lack of visibility that makes it difficult to secure their complex infrastructure.
* **Data volume challenges:** Cloud environments can generate a high volume of logs forcing security teams to make trade-offs when it comes to data ingest cost and visibility.
* **Multi-cloud challenges:** Many organizations use multiple cloud platforms causing visibility challenges across platforms.

#### LimaCharlie’s solution

LimaCharlie simplifies management of cloud and multi-cloud environments by unifying them on a single platform. In addition to making integrations easier and bringing scalability to security operations, the SecOps Cloud Platform offers:

* **Centralized monitoring:** The LimaCharlie SecOps Cloud Platform offers a unified view across cloud environments that gives users granular visibility into their operation and current state.
* **Highly efficient storage:** LimaCharlie’s proprietary high performance storage reduces the complexity and cost associated with long term data retention. All data ingested and alerts generated include a full year of searchable data retention to meet regulatory compliance and security requirements.
* **Platform-independence:** LimaCharlie is platform-independent and can ingest log data from any cloud platform or SaaS application with log retention often cheaper than the cloud vendors themselves.
