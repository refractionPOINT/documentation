Article summary

Thank you for your feedback!

The SecOps Cloud Platform (SCP) creates a scalable, versatile, and actionable observability pipeline by collecting and standardizing telemetry from the full security stack. Stream data from any input, route it to any output. The SCP provides visibility into telemetry sources and empowers users to create automated responses to actionable events in the pipeline.

#### Observability pipeline problems

Creating an observability pipeline can be a daunting task as users try to integrate a complex and diverse technological environment into a single pipeline solution. When successful, ingesting, managing, and storing data can create significant costs, including:

* **Data costs:** Collecting and storing telemetry can be extremely expensive. As your business grows, so does its data, leading to escalating data storage costs as well.
* **Infrastructure demands:** Creating, managing, and monitoring the infrastructure required to operate an observability pipeline requires system engineers. As this infrastructure grows to accommodate your business, so does the headcount needed to maintain operations.
* **Delayed responsiveness:** Traditional observability pipelines collect and route data.If something appears in the pipeline that warrants concern, it must be routed to a destination for further analysis before action occurs.
* **High SIEM costs:** Data ingestion adds considerable costs to SIEM operations. As an organization expands its digital footprint these costs can increase rapidly.
* **Vendor lock-in constraints:** Many organizations find themselves trapped with security vendors who deliberately create dependencies through restrictive contracts, proprietary data formats, and closed ecosystems — limiting flexibility, driving up costs, and forcing security decisions based on vendor limitations rather than actual security needs.

#### LimaCharlie’s solutions

The SecOps Cloud Platform unifies telemetry collection by using an API-first approach for integrating the security stack. It creates a natural observability pipeline that scales without limit, facilitates automated responses, and greatly reduces data costs across the board. With the SCP you get a fully interactive observability pipeline that can facilitate countless other critical security operations as well.

* **Free data retention:** LimaCharlie offers a rolling year of free data storage.
* **Infrastructure-as-a-Service:** LimaCharlie provides a scalable, cloud-native infrastructure on an API-first platform. This gives our users maximum flexibility, scalability, and integration capabilities across the full security stack, including the observability pipeline.
* **Instant, bi-directional response:** LimaCharlie supports bi-directionality which allows automated responses sent directly to the source of a detection. For example, if the SecOps Cloud Platform receives a suspicious login alert from O365 it can immediately send a response to suspend the account before telemetry is sent for further processing.
* **Reduce SIEM spend:** LimaCharlie makes it easy to send only relevant telemetry to your SIEM, while still retaining all of your data in storage. This instantly reduces the costs of operating your SIEM while also accommodating any regulatory compliance requirements involving your data.
* **No vendor lock-in:** The API-first nature of LimaCharlie allows you to integrate and use whatever security solutions, services, and resources you prefer. There are no contracts or artificial barriers put in place to restrict your choices.
