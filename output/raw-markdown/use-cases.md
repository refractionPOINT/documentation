The SCP is under continuous development which includes the regular addition of expanded features and capabilities. Newer features such as our Endpoint protection ([EPP](/v2/docs/ext-epp)) and our [MCP server](/v2/docs/mcp-server) are not yet included in the use case table, but make strong cases for adopting LimaCharlie in their own right.
