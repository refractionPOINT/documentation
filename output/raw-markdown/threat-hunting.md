Stop settling for static defenses – become a threat hunting powerhouse with LimaCharlie! One-year historical data, intuitive exploration, and seamless rule creation empower you to uncover hidden threats, predict future attacks, and continuously optimize your security posture for maximum resilience.

#### Threat hunting problems

* **Limited visibility into past activity:** Traditional security solutions focus on real-time threats, leaving hidden attacker footprints and lingering malware remnants undetected in historical data.
* **Cumbersome historical data analysis:** Complex log aggregation and analysis tools hinder efficient threat hunting investigations across vast datasets, delaying threat discovery and response.
* **Static detection and response:** The disconnect between reactive threat hunts and proactive defense leaves organizations vulnerable to future attacks from similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

#### LimaCharlie’s solution

* **Effortless Exploration with Intuitive Queries:** Utilize LimaCharlie's powerful search engine and pre-built queries to navigate historical data with ease. Find connections, identify anomalies, and conduct in-depth investigations without cumbersome tools.
* **From Hunt to Rule—Seamless Transformation:** Easily convert your threat hunting discoveries into actionable detection and response rules within LimaCharlie. Automate future defense against similar attacks by leveraging insights from your historical investigations, closing the loop between reactive hunting and proactive prevention.
* **Continuous Optimization—A Cycle of Resilience:** Re-run historical threat hunts with evolving queries and filters to adapt your detection and response rules as the threat landscape changes. Continuously refine your defenses based on new insights and stay ahead of adversaries.
