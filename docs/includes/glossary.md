*[Sensor Selector]: Many components in LimaCharlie require selecting a set of Sensors based on some characteristics. The selector expression is a text field that describes what matching characteristics the selector is looking for, like `plat==windows`, to select all Windows sensors.
*[LCQL]: LimaCharlie Query Language (LCQL) provides a flexible, intuitive and interactive way to explore your data in LimaCharlie. Telemetry ingested via sensors are searchable via LCQL.
*[Infrastructure-as-Code]: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the management and provisioning of IT infrastructure using code, making it easier to scale, maintain, and deploy resources consistently. In LimaCharlie, IaC allows security teams to deploy and manage sensors, rules, and other security infrastructure...
*[Extensions]: LimaCharlie Extensions allow users to expand and customize their security environments by integrating third-party tools, automating workflows, and adding new capabilities. Organizations subscribe to Extensions, which are granted specific permissions to interact with their infrastructure. Extensions...

*[Tag]: Tags in LimaCharlie are strings linked to sensors for classifying endpoints, automating detection and response, and triggering workflows. Tags appear in every event under the `routing` component and help simplify rule writing. Tags can be added manually, via API, or through detection & response...

*[Organization ID]: In LimaCharlie, an Organization ID is a unique identifier assigned to each tenant or customer account. It distinguishes different organizations within the platform, enabling LimaCharlie to manage resources, permissions, and data segregation securely. The Organization ID ensures that all telemetry,...

*[SID]: In LimaCharlie, a Sensor ID (SID) is a unique identifier assigned to each deployed endpoint agent (sensor). It distinguishes individual sensors across an organization's infrastructure, allowing LimaCharlie to track, manage, and communicate with each endpoint. The Sensor ID is critical for...

It distinguishes individual sensors across an organization's infrastructure, allowing LimaCharlie to track, manage, and communicate with each endpoint. The Sensor ID is critical for operations such...
*[Atom]: Atoms, within LimaCharlie, are Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs). An example might be: 1e9e242a512d9a9b16d326ac30229e7b. You can treat them as opaque values. These unique values are used to relate events together rather than using Process IDs, which are themselves unreliable.
*[Event Collection]: In LimaCharlie, Exfil (Event Collection) is a configuration extension that determines which types of events are collected and sent from endpoint agents to the cloud. It controls the data flow, ensuring only specified events are transmitted for monitoring and analysis. To capture specific events,...

*[DFIR]: Digital Forensics & Incident Response
*[CLI]: Command-line Interface
*[Stateful Rule]: In LimaCharlie, a Stateful Rule tracks and remembers the state of past events to make decisions based on historical context. Unlike stateless rules, which evaluate events in isolation, stateful rules can detect patterns over time, such as multiple failed logins within an hour. This enables more...

*[Organization]: In LimaCharlie, an Organization represents a tenant within the SecOps Cloud Platform, providing a self-contained environment to manage security data, configurations, and assets independently. Each Organization has its own sensors, detection rules, data sources, and outputs, offering complete...
*[MDR]: Managed Detection & Response
*[MSSP]: Managed Security Services Provider
*[EDR]: Endpoint Detection & Response
*[D&R]: Detection & Response
*[AWS]: Amazon Web Services
*[GCP]: Google Cloud Platform
*[Endpoint Agent]: Endpoint Agents are lightweight software agents deployed directly on endpoints like workstations and servers. These sensors collect real-time data related to system activity, network traffic, file changes, process behavior, and much more.
*[Adapter]: Adapters serve as flexible data ingestion mechanisms for both on-premise and cloud environments.
*[Installation Key]: Installation keys are Base64-encoded strings provided to Sensors and Adapters in order to associate them with the correct Organization. Installation keys are created per-organization and offer a way to label and control your deployment population.
*[Sensor]: Similar to agents, Sensors send telemetry to the LimaCharlie platform in the form of EDR telemetry or forwarded logs. Sensors are offered as a scalable, serverless solution for securely connecting endpoints of an organization to the cloud.
