# False Positive Rules

To reduce the number of false positives, you may want to create false positive (FP) rules. FP rules filter out detections generated by the `report` action of detection & response (D&R) rules. These rules apply globally across all rule namespaces and targets.

There are multiple ways to create a false positive rule in LimaCharlie web app.

Have multiple organizations?

Similar to detection & response rules, false positive rules are created on a per tenant level. This means that if you have more than one organization you want to apply the rule to, you will want to:

* re-create the same rule in multiple organizations, or
* using our infrastructure as code functionality, push your FP rules to multiple tenants within seconds.

## Use Cases

The typical use case for FP rules is to add exceptions from some detections that are cross-cutting (for example ignore all detections from a specific host), organization-specific exceptions (like ignoring alerts relating to a custom piece of software used in an organization), or suppressing errors from managed  rules you don't have direct access to.

## Structure

False positive rules are structured roughly the same as the detection part of a D&R rule. The main difference is that instead of a direct event, the rule applies to the content of a detection, as can be seen in the **Detections** section of the web app.

The originating event for the detection can still be accessed at the `detect` path. This means that if ignoring something based on the event content, we only need to add `detect/` to the front of the `path` (see [example](#ignore-detections-for-specific-file-name)).

## Create a False Positive Rule From Detections

This is the quickest and the most common way to create a FP rule. On every detection, you can click the `Mark False Positive` button.

Clicking the button will pre-populate the details of the event and automatically generate a draft false positive rule which you can edit before saving.

After the rule is saved, it will appear in the **False Positives Rules** section and can be edited/deleted there.

## Create a False Positive rule from scratch

While creating FP rule from detections is a common and easy way to reduce the number of false positives, you do not need to wait for the detection to happen before creating a FP rule. The `False Positive Rules` section under `Automation` allows you to create a false positive rule from scratch.

To create a new false positive rule, click the `New Rule` button.

This will open a rule editor allowing you to create a new rule.

An FP rule is structured with the same format at the detection component of a D&R rule. The main difference is that the rule applies to the content of a detection, as can be seen in the Detections section of the web app.

You have the ability to set a rule name as well as an **Expiry Date** (optional). Setting an expiry date allows you to create a rule that will expire at a certain time.

Please note that expiry times must be set in the user's preferred time (not in UTC).

## Examples

Clicking the button will pre-populate the details of the event and automatically generate a draft false positive rule which you can edit before saving. The details about the structure of the false positive rules can be found in our technical documentation.

### Suppress a Specific Detection

Prevent a specific detection:

```yaml
op: is
path: cat
value: my-detect-name
```

### Ignore Detections for Specific File Name

Ignore any detection that relates to a file name in any path.

```yaml
op: ends with
path: detect/event/FILE_PATH
value: this_is_fine.exe
```

### Ignore Detections on a Specific Host

Any detection originating from a specific host will be ignored.

```yaml
op: is
path: routing/hostname
value: web-server-2
```
