# Google Cloud Storage

## Overview

This Adapter allows you to ingest files/blobs stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

Note that this adapter operates as a sink by default, meaning it will "consume" files from the GCS bucket by deleting them once ingested.

## Configurations

Adapter Type: `gcs`

* `client_options`: common configuration for adapter as defined [here](../usage.md).
* `bucket_name`: the name of the bucket to ingest from.
* `service_account_creds`: the string version of the JSON credentials for a (Google) Service Account to use accessing the bucket.
* `prefix`: only ingest files with a given path prefix.
* `single_load`: if `true`, the adapter will not operate as a sink, it will ingest all files in the bucket once and will then exit.
