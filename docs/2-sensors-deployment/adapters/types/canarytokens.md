# Canarytokens

Canarytokens are a free, quick, painless way to help defenders discover they've been breached (by having attackers announce themselves). Canarytokens are digital traps, or tripwires, that can be placed in an organization's network as a "lure" for adversaries. When actioned against, canaries will fire an alert, that can be forwarded to LimaCharlie.

Canarytokens can be ingested in LimaCharlie via a Webhook Adapter, and are recognized as the `canary_token` platform.

## A Little More

LimaCharlie published a blog post in April 2023 to discuss the Canarytoken integration. You can read more about that [here](https://limacharlie.io/blog/early-warnings-with-limacharlie-and-canarytokens).

## Adapter Deployment

Canarytoken alerts are ingested via a cloud-to-cloud webhook Adapter configured to receive JSON events. The LimaCharlie platform has pre-built mapping for Canarytoken alerts. A Canarytokens Adapter can be initially deployed in two ways:

* Via the LimaCharlie web UI
* Via the LimaCharlie CLI

Regardless of which method utilized, Steps 2 and 3 will still be the same.

### 1a. Initial deployment via the LimaCharlie web UI

Within the LimaCharlie UI, navigate to **Sensors** > **Sensors List** > **+ Add** Sensor. Select the **Canary Token** option.

After selecting or creating an Installation Key, the web UI will ask you to name the Adapter and select a Secret value.

Click **Complete Cloud Installation** to create the cloud-to-cloud Adapter. Proceed to step 2 to continue.

### 1b. Initial deployment via the LimaCharlie CLI

A Canarytokens Adapter can be deployed via the LimaCharlie CLI. The following step is modified from the generic Webhook Adapter created documentation, found [here](../tutorials/webhook-adapter.md).

The following configuration can be modified to easily configure a Webhook Adapter for receiving Canarytokens events.

```json
{
    "sensor_type": "webhook",
    "webhook": {
       "secret": "canarytoken-secret",
        "client_options": {
            "hostname": "canarytokens",
            "identity": {
                "oid": "<your_oid>",
                "installation_key": "<your_installation_key>"
            },
            "platform": "canary_token",
            "sensor_seed_key": "canary-super-secret-key",
            "mapping" : {
                "event_type_path" : {{ 'Canarytoken Hit' }}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that in the mapping above, the `event_type_path` field is set to a static string of `Canarytoken Hit`. You can change this to any desired value.

To create this webhook adapter, run the following command, replacing `<json_config_file>` with the name of the config file from above:

`limacharlie hive set cloud_sensor --key canarytoken --data <json_config_file>`

### 2. Building the Webhook URL

After creating the webhook, you'll need to retrieve the webhook URL from the [Get Org URLs](https://api.limacharlie.io/static/swagger/get-org-urls) API call. You'll need the following information to complete the Webhook URL:

* Organization ID
* Webhook name (from the config)
* Secret (from the config)

Let's assume the returned domain looks like `9157798c50af372c.hook.limacharlie.io`, the format of the URL would be:

`https://9157798c50af372c.hook.limacharlie.io/OID/HOOKNAME/SECRET`

Note that the `secret` value can be provided in the webhook URL or as an HTTP header named `lc-secret`.

### 3. Configuring the Canaryalert Webhook Output

Navigate to the [Canarytokens generate page](https://canarytokens.org/generate) to create your token of choice.

Utilize the URL from Step 2 as the webhook URL. Provide a reminder note, which will also appear in the Canarytoken alert when tripped. Click **Create my Canarytoken**, which will provide you the content related to the selected token. When the Canarytoken is tripped, a webhook alert will be forwarded to the LimaCharlie Adapter.
