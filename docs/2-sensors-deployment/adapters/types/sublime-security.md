# Sublime Security

[Sublime Security](https://sublime.security/) is a comprehensive email security platform that allows users to create custom detections, gain visibility and control, and focus on prevention of malicious emails.

## Ingesting Audit Logs

Audit logs from Sublime can be ingested cloud-to-cloud via the API.

### Adapter-specific Options

Adapter Type: `sublime`

* `api_key`: your Okta API key/token

### CLI Deployment

Adapter downloads can be found [here](../deployment.md).

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/lc_adapter

/path/to/lc_adapter sublime client_options.identity.installation_key=$INSTALLATION_KEY \
client_options.identity.oid=$OID \
client_options.platform=sublime \
client_options.sensor_seed_key=$SENSOR_NAME \
client_options.hostname=$SENSOR_NAME \
api_key=$API_KEY
```

### Infrastructure as Code Deployment

```python
# Sublime Security Specific Docs: https://docs.limacharlie.io/docs/adapter-types-sublime-security
# For cloud sensor deployment, store credentials as hive secrets:

#   api_key: "hive://secret/sublime-api-key"

sensor_type: "sublime"
sublime:
  api_key: "hive://secret/sublime-api-key"
  client_options:
    identity:
      oid: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      installation_key: "YOUR_LC_INSTALLATION_KEY_SUBLIME"
    hostname: "sublime-security-adapter"
    platform: "json"
    sensor_seed_key: "sublime-audit-sensor"
    mapping:
      sensor_hostname_path: "user.email"
      event_type_path: "type"
      event_time_path: "created_at"
    indexing: []
```

## Ingesting Alerts

Sublime events can be ingested in LimaCharlie via a `json` Webhook Adapter configuration.

### Adapter Deployment

Sublime Security logs are ingested via a cloud-to-cloud webhook Adapter configured to receive JSON events. The steps of creating this Adapter and enabling the input include:

1. Creating the Webhook Adapter via the LimaCharlie CLI
2. Discovering the URL created for the Webhook Adapter.
3. Providing the completed URL to Sublime Security for webhook events.

#### 1. Creating the LimaCharlie Webhook Adapter

The following steps are modified from the generic Webhook Adapter creation documentation, found [here](../tutorials/webhook-adapter.md).

Creating a Webhook Adapter requires a set of parameters, including organization ID, Installation Key, platform, and mapping details, among other parameters. The following configuration can be modified to easily configure a Webhook Adapter for ingesting Sublime Security events:

```json
{
    "sensor_type": "webhook",
    "webhook": {
       "secret": "sublime-security",
        "client_options": {
            "hostname": "sublime-security",
            "identity": {
                "oid": "<your_oid>",
                "installation_key": "<your_installation_key>"
            },
            "platform": "json",
            "sensor_seed_key": "sublime-super-secret-key",
            "mapping" : {
                "event_type_path" : "data/flagged_rules/name",
                "event_time_path" : "created_at"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that in the mapping above, we make the following changes:

* `event_type_path` is mapped to the rule name from the Sublime alert
* `event_time_path` is mapped to the `created_at` field from the Sublime alert

#### 2. Building the Adapter URL

After creating the webhook, you'll need to retrieve the webhook URL from the [Get Org URLs](https://api.limacharlie.io/static/swagger/get-org-urls) API call. You'll need the following information to complete the Webhook URL:

* Organization ID
* Webhook name (from the config)
* Secret (from the config)

Let's assume the returned domain looks like `9157798c50af372c.hook.limacharlie.io`, the format of the URL would be:

`https://9157798c50af372c.hook.limacharlie.io/OID/HOOKNAME/SECRET`

Note that the `secret` value can be provided in the webhook URL or as an HTTP header named `lc-secret`.

#### 3. Configuring the Sublime webhook Action

Within the Sublime Security console, navigate to **Manage** > **Actions**. From here, you can select **New Action** > **Webhook**.

Within the **Configure webhook** menu, provide a name and the Adapter URL constructed in Step 2 above.

As mentioned in Step 2, you can configure the HTTP header `lc-secret`, if so desired.

Upon configuration of the webhook within Sublime Security, alerts can be configured to be sent to the LimaCharlie platform. To test the Webhook, select **Trigger Custom Action** from any Flagged message, and send to the LimaCharlie webhook.
