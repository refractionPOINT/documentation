# Sensor Cull

The Sensor Cull Extension performs continuous cleaning of "old" sensors that have not connected to an Organization within a set period of time. This is useful for environments with cloud deployments or VM/template-based deployments that may enroll sensors repeatedly, and for a short period of time.

The extension works by creating rules that describe when specified sensors should be cleaned up.

## Enabling the Sensor Cull Extension

To enable the Sensor Cull extension, navigate to the [Sensor Cull extension page](https://app.limacharlie.io/add-ons/extension-detail/ext-sensor-cull) in the LimaCharlie marketplace.

After clicking **Subscribe**, the Sensor Cull extension should be available almost immediately.

## Using the Sensor Cull Extension

Once enabled, you will see a **Sensor Cull** option under **Sensors** within the LimaCharlie web UI. You can also interact with the extension via REST API.

Within the Sensor Cull module, you have the ability to create rules. Sensor Cull rules are run automatically once a day, and can be edited as needed.

Each rule specifies a single sensor `tag` used as a selector for the sensors the rule applies to. A rule also has a `name` (simply used for your bookkeeping), and a `ttl` which is the number of days a sensor can remain unconnected to LimaCharlie before it becomes eligible for cleanup.

## Actions via REST API

The following REST API actions can be sent to interact with the Sensor Cull extension:

### get_rules

Get the list of existing rules

```json
{
  "action": "get_rules"
}
```

### run

Perform an ad-hoc cleanup.

```json
{
  "action": "run"
}
```

### add_rule

The following example creates a rule name `my new rule` that applies to all sensors with the `vip` Tag, and cleans them up when they have not connected in 30 days.

```json
{
  "action": "add_rule",
  "name": "my new rule",
  "tag": "vip",
  "ttl": 30
}
```

### del_rule

Delete an existing rule by name.

```json
{
  "action": "del_rule",
  "name": "my new rule"
}
```
