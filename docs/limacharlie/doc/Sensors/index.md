## Overview

LimaCharlie sensors are lightweight, cross-platform agents that provide:

- Real-time telemetry collection
- Remote command execution

- Process management

## Supported Platforms

- Windows (7, 8, 10, 11, Server 2008+)
- Linux (major distributions)
- macOS (10.13+)
- Chrome OS
- Cloud sensors for AWS, Azure, GCP

## Key Documentation

- [Installation Keys](installation-keys.md) - Create and manage sensor installation keys
- [Sensor Connectivity](sensor-connectivity.md) - Network requirements and connectivity options
- [Sensor Tags](sensor-tags.md) - Organize and manage sensors with tags

## Getting Started

1. Create an installation key for your target platform
2. Deploy the sensor using the installation key
3. Verify connectivity in the web console
4. Apply tags for organization and targeting
5. Start building detection rules
