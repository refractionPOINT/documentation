# Kubernetes Pods Logs

## Overview

This Adapter allows you to ingest the logs from the pods running in a Kubernetes cluster.

The adapter relies on local filesystem access to the standard Kubernetes pod logging structure. This means the adapter is best run as a Daemon Set in Kubernetes with the pod logs location mounted (usually `/var/log/pods`).

A public Docker container is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/refractionpoint/lc-adapter-k8s-pods) as `refractionpoint/lc-adapter-k8s-pods`.

## Configurations

Adapter Type: `k8s_pods`

The following fields are required for configuration:

* `client_options`: common configuration for adapter as defined [here](../adapter-usage.md).
* `root`: The root of the Kubernetes directory storing logs, usually `/var/log/pods`.

### Infrastructure as Code Deployment

## Sample Kubernetes Configuration

An example Daemon Set configuration for Kubernetes:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: lc-adapter-k8s-pods
  namespace: default
spec:
  minReadySeconds: 30
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: lc-adapter-k8s-pods
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: lc-adapter-k8s-pods
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: refractionpoint/lc-adapter-k8s-pods
        name: lc-adapter-k8s-pods
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /k8s-pod-logs
          name: pod-logs
        env:
        - name: K8S_POD_LOGS
          value: /k8s-pod-logs
        - name: OID
          value: aaaaaaaa-bfa1-bbbb-cccc-138cd51389cd
        - name: IKEY
          value: aaaaaaaa-9ae6-bbbb-cccc-5e42b854adf5
        - name: NAME
          value: k8s-pods
      volumes:
      - hostPath:
          path: /var/log/pods
        name: pod-logs
  updateStrategy:
