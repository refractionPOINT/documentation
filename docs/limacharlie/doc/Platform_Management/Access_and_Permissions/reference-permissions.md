# Reference: Permissions

## Overview

LimaCharlie uses a granular permission system that controls access to all platform functionality. Permissions are applied through User accounts, API Keys, or Groups and follow a hierarchical naming convention: `category`.`action`

## Permission Structure

### Naming Convention

* **Category**: Functional area (e.g. sensor, org, dr)
* **Action**: Operation type (e.g. get, list, set, del, ctrl)

## Permission Application

Permissions can be applied through:

1. **User Accounts**: Direct assignment to individual users
2. **API Keys**: Embedded in API key configurations for programmatic access
3. **Groups**: Assigned to groups, then inherited by group members

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions required
2. **Use Groups**: Manage permissions through groups rather than individual assignments
3. **Regular Auditing**: Periodically review and audit permission assignments
4. **Separate Environments**: Use different permission sets for development, staging, and production
5. **API Key Management**: Rotate API keys regularly and scope them appropriately
