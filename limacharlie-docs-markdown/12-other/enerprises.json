      ". Teams should begin by identifying their one-off tools and vendors and determining how they can be replaced with an SCP solution. The SecOps Cloud Platform offers a rich ecosystem of [100+ cybersecurity capabilities and integrations](https://limacharlie.io/secops-cloud-platform-guide-enterprise-soc#:~:text=100%2B%20cybersecurity%20capabilities%20and%20integrations) and a [marketplace of add-ons](https://docs.limacharlie.io/docs/add-ons) to extend the platform. In many cases, teams will find that it is possible to replace single-use vendors with an SCP solution that offers equal or better performance, reducing tool sprawl and improving security operations at the same time.",
