# API Integrator Skill - Refactored Structure

This skill has been refactored to comply with best practices using the Progressive Disclosure pattern.

## File Structure

- **SKILL.md** (334 lines) - Main entry point with overview, authentication, quick start, common operations
- **PYTHON.md** (845 lines) - Complete Python SDK reference with all classes, methods, and examples
- **GO.md** (997 lines) - Complete Go SDK reference with all packages, methods, and examples
- **EXAMPLES.md** (1,003 lines) - Four complete working code examples
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** (859 lines) - Error handling, debugging, and common issues

## Navigation Flow

Users start with SKILL.md which provides:
1. Quick overview of capabilities
2. Authentication basics
3. Quick start for both SDKs
4. 5 most common operations
5. Event streaming overview
6. Clear navigation links to detailed documentation

For detailed information, users follow links to:
- PYTHON.md for Python SDK details
- GO.md for Go SDK details
- EXAMPLES.md for complete working examples
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md for error handling

## Benefits

1. **Compliant**: SKILL.md is 334 lines (< 500 line limit)
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Users get quick info first, details on demand
3. **Maintainable**: Each file has a clear, focused purpose
4. **Complete**: All original content preserved and organized
5. **Cross-referenced**: Clear navigation between files

## Original vs New

- **Original**: 1,709 lines (341% over limit)
- **New**: Distributed across 5 focused files
- **SKILL.md**: 334 lines (67% of limit, 33% headroom)
